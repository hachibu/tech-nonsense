# tech-nonsense

A [Markov chain](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/moderninfotheory/v/markov_chains) based tech-nonsense generator.

#### Examples
- embrace feature-rich clustering.
- target open-source supervised learning.
- repurpose peer-to-peer computing.
- embrace bleeding-edge metrics.
- brute-force open-source disk encryption.
- reinvent feature-rich recursive neural networks.
- elegant turn-key hashing.
- massive neural networks.
- cultivate back-end cryptocurrency.
- monetize mission-critical bot-nets.
- unleash plug-and-play paradigms.
- brute-force exhaustive hyper-cloud.
- byzantine supervised learning.
- feature-rich recursive neural networks.
- target user-centric paradigms.

## Algorithm

1. Randomly combine nouns, verbs and adjectives into sentences of:
   - verb adjective noun.
   - adjective noun.
2. Feed the sentences into the Markov chain to train it.
3. Use the Markov chain to generate sentences that:
   - end with a period.
   - are not too short.
